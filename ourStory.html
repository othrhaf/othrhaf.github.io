                        <h2>Company</h2>
                        <p>Established in 2001 by Stasi Malloy. She dedicated her life to training people and their dogs to have richer and fuller lives. She wanted people to know how easy training. She attended UMKC working on a degree in law. After graduation she decided the corporate world wasn’t for her. Her passion for dog training needed to be. Working as a trainer at a national pet retail chain, her vast knowledge was apparent. She became the trainer of the dog trainers. She went on to ensconce ABC. Where she worked to guide people to training their dogs.</p>

                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I have been training with dogs for over 20 years. First as a pet parent then started teaching in 2006 under Stasi’s guidance.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 2004 I joined Dog Scouts of America. The DSA Mission is to improve the lives of dogs, their owners, and society through humane education, positive training, and community involvement. My oldest dog, Bailey earned the Dog Scout title and went on to earn numerous merit badges. She was also a certified Therapy Dog. My younger dog Keena, has followed in her sister’s footstep although their area od interest vastly varies. She’s my Agility, Rally and Musical Freestyle dog.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        I was first introduced to Positive Reinforcement training when I acquired my first African Grey Parrot, Skully. Obviously, I couldn’t put a collar and leash on him and train in the traditional methods that I was being taught to train my dogs. In my search for a method to train my Parrot I was introduced to Positive Reinforcement Training for the first time.
                        <br>
                        <br> 
                        My dogs and I have competed in Agility, Rally (a fun way to do obedience), Musical Freestyle (dancing with your dog), as well as other sports. We have performed for various non-profit groups, schools and week end fairs. Add a newspaper picture.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I have workied with a large variety of dog breeds and mixes. Different ages and temperaments. Nothing fulfills me more than to see the light bulb flash on when
                        dogs realize that their revered people are hearing them. A whole new world has opened. They are now in a relationship with their pack.</p>
